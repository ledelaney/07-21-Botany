## title slide

+ Hi everyone, my name is Lucy and I'm a PhD candidate in evolutionary biology at the University of Illinois at Chicago
+ I'm excited to speak to you today about one of my dissertation chapters examining the phylogenetic distribution and frequency of self-incompatibility -- the inability of a plant to self fertilize -- in fabaceae

## slide one

+ As nitrogen fixers the legumes play an indispensable ecological role, but this group is also deeply enmeshed with the rise of human civilization***. 
+ Fabaceae species comprised half of the Neolithic founder crops domesticated by the first farming communities in the early Holocene approximately 10,000 years ago. 
+ And along with their rich agricultural significance is enduring evidence of the human fascination with beans, woven throughout cultures of antiquity. 
+ Both ancient Egyptians and Greeks believed beans to be symbols of immortality and the soul; Faba beans are featured repeatedly in _De Re Conquinaria_, the very first cookbook; they are depicted in ancient drawings used by the Aztecs as dice. 
+ In _Genesis_, Esau relinquishes his birthright to Jacob for a bowl of lentils. 
+ and In the _Iliad_, Homer compares arrows bouncing from a breastplate to chickpeas thrown by a winnower. 

## slide two

+ Still today Fabaceae remains the second most agriculturally and economically important plant family behind grasses. 
+ Beyond agricultural importance, Fabaceae species exhibit a practically unparalleled diversity of traits and features. 
+ Growth forms include trees, shrubs, vines and herbs; they display a stunning diversity of floral features and morphology; as well as complex chromosomal evolution***. 
+ Some genera are monotypic like _Tamarindus_; some contain nearly 3,000 species like _Astragalus_. 
+ In fact, just five genera contain a quarter of all legume species. 
+ What accounts for the vibrant diversity and cosmopolitan distribution of the Fabaceae family observed today?

## slide three

+ well, traits that influience mating or mating strategies are thought to have profound evolutionary consequences
+ sex influences the amount and the distribution of variation among organisms, determining the possibilities available for natural selection to act upon
+ this influences the evolutionary pathways available to species and ultimately the evolution of all other traits
+ many higher eukaryotes segregate sexes into seperate male and female organisms, or rely on a host of behavioral adaptations or even taboos to regulate mating pairs
+ but flowering plants are unique in these respects, with nearly 95% being hermaphroditic -- including both male and female parts -- and lacking in any kind of behavior
+ so they've developed a host of complex and sophisticated adaptations that govern mating
+ and perhaps not surprisingly, they are one of the most diverse and widespread groups of organisms on the planet, and possess the most varied reproductive structures of any group of organisms on earth

## slide four

+ so here is my rudimentary cartoon of the basic male and female reproductive organs of the flower
+ and since most plants are hermaphrodites, pollen can technically come from two places: sel or not self
+ and many plants limit self-fertilization by morphological or temporal means, so that the anthers can't reach the stigma or the stigma is not receptive when the anthers dehisce (?)
+ but many plants possess invisible genetic mechanisms that allow them to recognize and reject their own pollen, allowing them to control the genotype of pollen that is ultimately able to fertilize and ovule
+ this adaptation is known under the broad umbrella term of "homomorphic self-incompatibility" or SI and it's found in an estimate half or more of angiosperm species


## slide five

+ here is a phylogeny representing 56 orders of monocots and eudicots
+ and highlighted in red are orders in which there are documented cases of SI species
+ these arrows indicate where we know something about the genetic or molecular underpinnings of the SI phenotype...
+ but not all genetic or molecular underpinnings are the same!
+ several _different_ molecular systems have been uncovered across monocots and eudicots, and current work indicates as many as 35 independently-evolved SI systems may exist
+ so i'm going to zoom in on core eudiocts here and focus specifically on these orders
+ some families in these orders are known to operate with an SI system that shares remarkable genetic and molecular similiarities, known as RNase-based self-incompatibility or RSI
+ these similarities -- and the distant relationships between these groups -- have led to the hypothesis that RSI is homologous and therefore ancestral to core eudicots
+ fabaceae, here in fabales, has long been hypothesized to share this ancestral system

## slide six

+ there are a good many reasons to think that fabaceae may indeed utilize this system as SI in Fabaceae has been shown to share a great many phenotypic features of RSI
+ for starters, the genotype that determines the rejection in RSI is the pollen -- that is, the rejection is gametophytic, which is true in all investigated Fabaceae species
+ RSI is generally characterized by wet styles and binucleate pollen, also found in most Fabaceae species
+ the presence of RSI in the closely-related Rosaceae and the hypothesis that this system is ancestral to core eudicots added compelling data to this intial evidence

## slide seven

+ despite these long-standing questions about the mechanism or mechanisms responsible for SI in Fabaceae, data on breeding systems in the group has not been collected or summarized for forty years, since arroyo in 1981
+ in the intervening years, we've learned more about SI in general and RSI specifically, including evidence that SI is known to correlate with some other traits like longevity or growth habit
+ and also that the RSI mechanism generally breaks down when there is a polyploidization event -- meaning that there is an association between polyploidy and self-compatibility
+ RSI has also been historically challenging to diagnose, but recent advances

+ so to examine the current state of knowledge on the phylogenetic distribution and frequency of SI in fabaceae -- along with the overall weight of evidence that RSI may be operating in Fabaceae -- we collected data from 366 published empircal papers, theses, monographs, conservation reports and flora and field guides with a special emphasis on breeding systems and potentially correlated traits
+ we also collected stylar tissue of
