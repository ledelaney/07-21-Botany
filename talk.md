## title slide

+ Hi everyone, my name is Lucy and I'm a PhD candidate in evolutionary biology at the University of Illinois at Chicago
+ I'm excited to speak to you today about on of my favorite families of flowering plants, the beans, and some of my favorite flowering plant traits, genetic mechanisms that prevent self-fertilization or self-incompatibility

## slide one: images of all the shit you describe

+ As nitrogen fixers the legumes play an indispensable ecological role, but this group is also deeply entangled with the rise of human civilization 
+ Fabaceae species comprised half of the Neolithic founder crops domesticated by the first farming communities in the early Holocene 10,000 years ago. 
+ And along with their rich agricultural significance is enduring evidence of the human fascination with beans, woven throughout cultures of antiquity. 
+ Both ancient Egyptians and Greeks believed beans to be symbols of immortality and the soul; Faba beans are featured repeatedly in _De Re Conquinaria_, the very first cookbook; they are depicted in ancient drawings used by the Aztecs as dice. 
+ In _Genesis_, Esau relinquishes his birthright to Jacob for a bowl of lentils. 
+ and In the _Iliad_, Homer compares arrows bouncing from a breastplate to chickpeas thrown by a winnower. 

## slide two: maybe a tree you can like highlight certain portions of?

+ Still today thousands of years later Fabaceae remains the second most agriculturally and economically important plant family behind grasses. 
+ And beyond agricultural importance, the nearly 20,000 Fabaceae species exhibit a practically unparalleled diversity of traits and features. 
+ Growth forms include trees, shrubs, vines and herbs; they display a stunning diversity of floral features and morphology; as well as highly complex chromosomal evolution
+ Some genera are monotypic like _Tamarindus_; some contain almost 3,000 species like _Astragalus_. 
+ The three historically recognized subfamilies of Fabaceae show marked differences in distribution, morphology and chromosomal evolution-- with the Mimosoid and Caesalpinoid lineages being the oldest, consisting of mostly tropical trees, and the enormous, widespread and mostly herbaceous papilinoideae, the youngest subfamily
+ All together the family is made up of nearly 20,000 species
+ So what accounts for the vibrant diversity and cosmopolitan distribution of the Fabaceae family observed today?

## slide three: shit ton of fabaceae flowers?

+ well, traits that influience mating or mating strategies are thought to have profound evolutionary consequences
+ sex influences the amount and the distribution of variation among organisms, determining the possibilities available for natural selection to act upon
+ this influences the evolutionary pathways available to species and ultimately the evolution of all other traits
+ many higher eukaryotes segregate sexes into seperate male and female organisms, or rely on a host of behavioral adaptations or even taboos to regulate mating pairs
+ but flowering plants are unique in these respects, with nearly 95% being hermaphroditic -- including both male and female parts -- and obviously lacking in any kind of behavior
+ so they've developed a host of complex and sophisticated adaptations that govern mating
+ and perhaps not surprisingly, flowering plants are one of the most diverse and widespread groups of organisms on the planet, and possess the most varied reproductive structures of any group of organisms on earth -- this is especially true in fabaceae

## slide four: style and pollen from your shitty AI drawing

+ so here is my rudimentary cartoon of the basic male and female reproductive organs of the flower
+ and since most plants -- and nearly all fabaceae species -- are hermaphrodites, pollen can technically come from two places: self or not self
+ and many plants limit self-fertilization by morphological or temporal means, so that the anthers can't reach the stigma or the stigma is not receptive when the anthers are deshiscing
+ but many plants possess invisible genetic mechanisms that allow them to recognize and reject their own pollen, allowing them to control the genotype of pollen that is ultimately able to fertilize their ovules
+ this trait is known under the broad umbrella term of "homomorphic self-incompatibility" or SI and it's found in an estimated half or more of angiosperm species

## slide five: phylogeny of orders from prelims

+ here is a phylogeny representing 56 orders of monocots and eudicots
+ and highlighted in red are orders in which there are documented cases of SI 
+ these arrows indicate where we know something about the genetic or molecular underpinnings of the SI phenotype...
+ but to complicate matters, not all genetic or molecular underpinnings are the same!
+ that is, several _different_ molecular systems have been uncovered across monocots and eudicots, and current work indicates as many as 35 independently-evolved SI systems may exist
+ for now i'm going to zoom in on core eudiocts here and focus specifically on these orders
+ some families in these orders are known to operate with an SI system that shares remarkable genetic and molecular similiarities, known as RNase-based self-incompatibility or RSI
+ these similarities -- and the distant relationships between these groups -- have led to the hypothesis that RSI is homologous and therefore ancestral to core eudicots
+ fabaceae, here in fabales, has long been hypothesized to share this ancestral system

## slide six: check boxes rsi versus fabaceae

+ there are a good reasons to think that fabaceae may indeed utilize this system, as SI in Fabaceae has been shown to share a great many phenotypic features of RSI
+ for starters, the genotype that determines the rejection in RSI is the pollen -- that is, the rejection is gametophytic -- this is true in all investigated Fabaceae species
+ RSI is generally characterized by wet styles and binucleate pollen, also found in most Fabaceae species
+ and, the presence of RSI in the closely-related Rosaceae and the hypothesis that this system is ancestral to core eudicots also adds compelling data to this intial evidence

## slide seven: add more checkboxes to features of rsi versus si? / flow chart for method description

+ now, despite these long-standing questions about the mechanism responsible for SI in Fabaceae, data on breeding systems in the group has not been collected or summarized for forty years, since arroyo in 1981
+ the truth is, we're not entirely sure what's going on--
+ in the intervening years, we've learned more about SI in general and RSI specifically
+ more evidence has accummulated demonstrating the SI correlates with other traits like stem composition and longevity
+ and we also know now that the RSI mechanism generally breaks down when there is a polyploidization event -- meaning that there is an association between polyploidy and self-compatibility, or the ability to self-fertilize
+ RSI has been historically challenging to confirm, but recent work takes advantage of distinctive molecular markers present in the stylar tissue of species that possess this system --> allowing for a fast and cheap way to identify RSI species
+ so to examine the current state of knowledge on the phylogenetic distribution and frequency of SI in fabaceae -- along with the overall weight of evidence that RSI may be operating in the group -- we collected data from 366 published works, including empircal papers, theses, monographs, conservation reports and flora and field guides with a special emphasis on breeding systems and potentially correlated traits
+ we also tested stylar tissue of several species in a previously untested subfamily -- Caesalpinioideae -- for the presence of RSI molecular markers

## slide eight: genus- and species-level phylogenies

+ we ended up with published work from 1886 through 2018, with data on breeding systems for 1167 species across 184 genera
+ our data accounts for roughly 6 percent of the family, with no data for more than 400 genera
+ this is a genus-level phylogeny of fabaceae, with circles scaled to represent the relative size of each genus -- you can see _Astragalus_ right here...
+ and these colors indicate the percent of each genus for which we have breeding system data -- but this scale is a bit skewed here, so we have very limited data, even for the genera where we know something
+ we do find the highest proportion of SI species in the oldest and woodiest subfamilies, and, as arroyo originally notes, a trend toward increasing herbaceousness and self-compatibility in papilionoideae
+ there are some exceptions with SI reports from _Trifolium_***
+ BASICALLY, SHOW AND REPEAT SPECIES LEVEL BS TREE
+ you can see that in general, there is still quite a bit of missing data

## slide nine: ISI calculation and ISI fig demo

+ so, how do we tell if a species is SI or not?
+ the best way of actually establishing this is through manual pollination experiments that allow for the calculation of the index of self-incompatibility or ISI
+ ISI is 1- the ratio of selfed/outcrossed fruits produced, where 1 means a plant is full SI and zero fully SC
+ in previous families, the expression of SI has been shown to be bimodal, with the majority of species being fully SI or SC
+ this fits in line with theoretical expectations indicating that these are alternative stable states
+ this bimodal pattern has been shown in families that possess RSI, other SI mechanisms or even where the SI mechanism is as yet unknown, including Asteraceae, Brassicaceae, Solanaceae, Cactaceae and Orchidaceae
+ so i guess not surprisingly, we also found the same bimodal expression of SI in Fabaceae with ISI data for 308 species across 95 genera

## slide ten: this seems to be another slide about how to distinguish RSI -- need to be moved?

+ in addition to examining seven caesalpinoid species for the presence of RSI molecular makers, we also collected data to help assess what mechanism may responsible for SI in the group
+ historically, determining whether a species possesses RSI is an expensive and time-consuming process
+ since the pollen tube is known to break down in the style (as opposed to the stigma or beyond the style), site of pollen tube inhibition is one indicator of SI mechanism
+ detailed crossing experiments can establish patterns of inheritance among individuals ***
+ lastly the identification of an S-locus can definitively establish RSI, the location of the coding regions for the male and female molecular components responsible for the function of SI

### another slide?

+ in fabaceae, site of pollen tube inhibition is available for just over 30 species, showing a wide variety of arrests including stigma, style, and various post-fertitilization mechanisms
+ this wide variability is not indicative of any specific SI mechanism
+ only seven studies have investigated the genetics of SI in the group in the youngest and largest subfamily papilionoidee: four in _Trifolium_, two in _Lotus_ and one in _Melilotis_.
+ while Casey et al. identified a putative S-locus in _Trifolium repens_, the genetics of SI in the group are still poorly understood
+ SI response across _Trifolium_ is also varied: pollen tube arrest is noted on both the stigma and the style, and to the best of our knowledge, this genus includes some of the only reports of species that are both annual and SI
+ so despite the identification of a putative S-locus there is not a lot of evidence of a shared SI mechanism

## slide eleven: use emojis for traits list correlation status small underneath

+ we also performed phylogenetically corrected generalized linear models to assess possible corelations between SI and three other binary traits: stem composition (herbaceous or woody), longevity (annual or perennial) and ploidy (diploid or polyploid)
+ this analysis should be interpreted with caution: given that there is no clear shared SI mechanism, we don't know whether or not SI constitutes a single trait or more than one trait
+ we also only have data on these traits for 196 of nearly 20,000 species
+ that said, in our best performing models we find evidence of correlation between SI and perennial habit, but no evidence of correlation between SI and ploidy
+ a lack of correlation would suggest that RSI is not operating in these species, as this mechanism is known to break down in polyploids

## slide twelve

+ Aguiar looked for the genes of RSI molecular markers expressed in the style in several Papilionoid species
+ given the varied phenotypic expression of SI in this subfamily, along with the recent work that suggests a whole genome duplication occurring in the common ancestor of papilinoids, it's unlikely that RSI is operating in this group
+ however in the older caesalpinoid lineage, there are some diploid species that do exhibit some features similar to RSI like pollen tube arrest in the style 
+ we examined seven of these species for the presence of characteristic molecular markers in stylar tissue but we did not find them

## conclusion

+ given the paucity of data, it's difficult to make any definitive claims
+ however, our findings are not indicative of RSI, or of any single SI mechanism operating
    - arrests all over
    - confusing and murky gentics --> summarize these in a figure?
    - no evidence of a correlation between polyploidy and SC
    - no RNases, but should be smarter about where we look in the future
+ we make this dataset publicly available so that others may use it to inform future work on the family
+ thanks so much, and I'm happy to take any questions!
