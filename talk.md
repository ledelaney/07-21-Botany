## title slide

+ Hi everyone, my name is Lucy and I'm a PhD candidate in evolutionary biology at the University of Illinois at Chicago
+ I'm excited to speak to you today about one of my dissertation chapters examining the phylogenetic distribution and frequency of self-incompatibility -- the inability of a plant to self fertilize -- in fabaceae

## slide one

+ As nitrogen fixers the legumes play an indispensable ecological role, but this group is also deeply enmeshed with the rise of human civilization***. 
+ Fabaceae species comprised half of the Neolithic founder crops domesticated by the first farming communities in the early Holocene approximately 10,000 years ago. 
+ And along with their rich agricultural significance is enduring evidence of the human fascination with beans, woven throughout cultures of antiquity. 
+ Both ancient Egyptians and Greeks believed beans to be symbols of immortality and the soul; Faba beans are featured repeatedly in _De Re Conquinaria_, the very first cookbook; they are depicted in ancient drawings used by the Aztecs as dice. 
+ In _Genesis_, Esau relinquishes his birthright to Jacob for a bowl of lentils. 
+ In the _Iliad_, Homer compares arrows bouncing from a breastplate to chickpeas thrown by a winnower. 

## slide two

+ And still today Fabaceae remains the second most agriculturally and economically important plant family behind grasses. 
+ Beyond agricultural importance, Fabaceae species exhibit a practically unparalleled diversity of traits and features. 
+ Trees, shrubs, vines and herbs; stunning diversity of floral features and morphology; complex chromosomal evolution***. 
+ Some genera are monotypic (_Tamarindus_); some contain nearly 3,000 species (_Astragalus_). 
+ In fact, just five genera contain a quarter of all legume species. 
+ What accounts for the vibrant diversity and cosmopolitan distribution of the Fabaceae family observed today?
